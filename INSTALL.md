## Install Python

To get started working with Python 3, you’ll need to have access to the Python interpreter. There are several common ways to accomplish this:

Python can be obtained from the Python Software Foundation website at python.org. Typically, that involves downloading the appropriate installer for your operating system and running it on your machine.
Some operating systems, notably Linux, provide a package manager that can be run to install Python.
On macOS, the best way to install Python 3 involves installing a package manager called Homebrew. You’ll see how to do this in the relevant section in the tutorial.

## Install Pipenv

Pipenv is a Python dependency manager. Functionally, it’s a combination of pip and virtualenv. It’s officially recommended by Python.org. It’s used it to install and keep track of required project dependencies and keep them isolated from the rest of the system.

    pip install pipenv
